      <description>Hello! It’s been quite a while since there was any content on the site - my last post was before the grand final. However, I have been doing a bit of work behind the scenes as you may notice. I thought I would give a quick update on a few things about the blog and what you can look forward to this year.
Blog migration As you may have noticed, my blog is looking a little funky.</description>

      <description>Unless you&amp;rsquo;ve been too distracted by US politics, you should know that tonight marks the start of a pretty big step forwards in women&amp;rsquo;s sport in this country. The AFL women&amp;rsquo;s competition has finally arrived!
When it first got announced, I decided that I&amp;rsquo;d like to try to include it in my blog. There is plenty of content around celebrating the amazing stories around some of these athletes and I encourage you to read as much as you can.</description>
