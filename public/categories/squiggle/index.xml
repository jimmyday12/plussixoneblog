      <description>For those who follow me, I’m sure you are well aware of The Squiggle run by Max Barry. In recent years, Max has done some amazing work at combining a bunch of different Footy models in one place. He recently created an API and Rob and I have now integrated it into the latest version of fitzRoy.
There is a lot of value at having this information available. I’m hoping to delve into that throughout the year.</description>
