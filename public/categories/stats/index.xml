      <description>Over the weekend, Tom Liberatore managed to equal the record for the most tackles laid in a game in the history of recording the measure (since 1986[ref]at least on afltables.com[/ref]) with 19. He could have absolutely smashed the record considering he was on 17 tackles at 3&amp;frasl;4 time. This is also the second time this year the record has been equalled, after Jack Zieballs 19 tackles in Round 3, with the original record set by Jude Bolton in Round 3, 2011.</description>
