                  Well here we are, another year, another frantic scramble to get my ratings up. As some of you may know, I’ve had a busy offseason moving this blog over to blogdown. This has meant I’ve had to rewrite all of my old code which was incredibly messy. It was also written while I was still learning R and so it wasn’t my best work. That whole re-write is still a work in progress (hence no pre-season simulations) but I’m getting there.
