      <description>The new AFL season, with it’s condensed fixture, is proving challenging for the old little R package fitzRoy. Luckily I’ve added a couple new functions to help!
You’ll need the development version of the package.
devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;jimmyday12/fitzRoy&amp;quot;) library(fitzRoy) library(dplyr) Fixture I recently noticed that the get_fixture function was broken. There is unfortunately not a lot I can do with that one. The Footywire website doesn’t provide round in it’s outputs and so I’ve always just calculated this assuming that rounds begin on Thursday/Friday and finish on Sunday/Monday.</description>

      <description>For those of you who’ve been following me on Twitter, you’ll know that I’ve been working on an R package for AFL called fitzRoy with Rob from Analysis of AFL. Today we released a new version which has a much requested feature, so I’d figured a blog post was in order.
You’ll have to reinstall fitzRoy to get the latest functions. We still aren’t on CRAN but you can use devtools to get it.</description>
