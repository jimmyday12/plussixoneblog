                  In celebration of the World Cup in Russia, I’ve decided to take on Betfair’s World Cup Datathon. See below my series of posts outlining how I built my models.
This is part of a series of posts on the World Cup Betfair datathon. See the links to others below.
Part 1 - Intro
Part 2 - Data Acquisition

<p>For those looking for AFLW content - hang tight! Unfortunately, due to the new nature of AFLW, data is hard to come by. I managed in the first season by manually adding data after each game but this is not feasible. I’m hoping, with help from <a href="https://twitter.com/anoafl">anoafl</a>, to add some data scraping into our newly released <code>fitzRoy</code> package. Details on that can be found <a href="https://jimmyday12.github.io/fitzRoy/">here</a></p>

                  The AFL Analytics community is wonderfully inclusive and supportive. If you are looking for discussions about AFL Analytics, I highly reccomend Twitter. There is a very active commnity there.
AFL Data Most of the data I use comes from the following two websites
AFL Tables
Footy Wire
 AFL Analytics Below are some fantastic blogs that I could only dream to be. They create some amazing content week in week out.

I am a data loving Biomechanist by trade. I graduated from my PhD in 2016 form the University of Queensland. I&rsquo;m currently currently working in Sports Science Research and Development at a Brisbane based sports technology company, Fusion Sport.
I&rsquo;m using this blog mostly to develop better skills in data science, in particular using R, developing visualisations and understanding various machine learning techniques. I am also obsessed with AFL.
