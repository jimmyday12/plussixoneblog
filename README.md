# plussixoneblog
This repo now houses data for my website [plussixoneblog](www.plussixoneblog.com). 

It formally also contained the static code files to generate the site contents via blogdown, Hugo and Netlify. I have since moved the website to the Quarto framework and all code now lives on the repo [jimmyday_12/plussixone_quarto][github.com/jimmday_12/plussixone_quarto]. 

This repo will continuously try to find new data using the script in `scripts/weekly_data_process` and store the updating data files in `data_files`.
